//look in the url with the id and
//see the properties of the API object->
//breack down the structure
//for compiler to chue the data
//so we can assighn property names
//and turn into a swift object
//WeatherData needs to adupt Decodable protocol
//meaning the WeatherData turned into a type that can decode itself from an external representation
//namely the JSON representation
//WeatherData is Decodable go to Weather Manager initilise it as let decoder


//typealias codable = Decodable + encodable

//property names have to maych with JSON object
//you can copy the path of value/ pathe from the json page
//in order do use the path of the JSON data, have to take the entire piece of data propery
//a object with five items, and that object has these properties: temp, pressure, humidity,
//That means we actually need another struct which I'm just going to call Main.
//And this, again, has to be Decodedable.
